# About This Project

The thesis project for my master's in Sonic Arts at Goldsmiths, UOL. In this project, I explore the ways computational technology can be used to dynamically and meaningfully communicate musical ideas.

This has the following tertiary structure:

* Conceptual – Exploring the parallels between concepts in both computing and music
* System Application – Rapid prototyping of computational interventions in the audio-visual feedback loop
* Workshops with artists – Auto-ethnographic, reflexive sessions; trying out, and developing the systems in real-time with practising artists. Eventually, the System Usability Scale and Creativity Support Index will be utilised to reflect upon the meaningfulness of the information presented.

This will culminate in a research paper, an archive of live performances and this site – a repository of ideas generated throughout the project.
