# Pitch Flocking [emergent behaviour]


## [technical term...] Ensemble coordination

When an ensemble plays together in good faith, the majority of the time, all players are listening to eachother, trying to compliment their bandfellows as appropriate. (CITATION NEEDED) This often happens dialectically, as musicians over then undershoot their approximations of unison/harmony. This good faith coordination is needed in all music along the aleatoric spectrum, whether it be (coordination to conductors baton...) or (...reference buddha piece that petes ensemble did...). The musician cannot control other musicians, and yet somehow they coordinate themeselves around one another to form a coherent whole....

## Boids

When....(history of boid algorithm/other flocking algorithms), (they) outlined how groups of objects might perform deterministic/formally significant actions without controlling one another. Each actor in a boid simulation observes features about its neighbors, and – manipulating this information with a few rules 

these rules being....

separation (steer to avoid crowding local flockmates)
alignmenet: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (COM) of local flockmates

– behaves under the maxim such that....(js mill quote)

## Applying Boids In Traditional Frameworks

We might want to instruct the musicians in our ensemble to make a concerted effort to behave under such a maxim. 

Uses in swarm robotics???

First we would have to identify suitable **features** (aspects of a sound that we look out for) to feed into our algorithm. Then we would present this algorithm to our musicians in a means that allows for simple transformation of the data. With traditional, static media, such a systemic score might be presented as:

feature: pitch

    Separation: Do not be at the same pitch as your "nearby" musicians

    Alignment: Your pitch should head in the same direction as the group (on average)

    Cohesion: Aim to be as close to those pitches at the centre/average of your group

....

add examples of people playing a static version of the score



Gripes, give examples for each....:

(but what does "nearby" mean? Do we mean physical proximity in the space???)

(additionally, how does a musician reconcile at once all three maxims? This has been approximated with pieces such as, but (add examples of people playing this and playing a static version of the score))

(tolerance limit for the concept of "sameness" is?)



## Computational Augmentation of Boid-Music Applications 


Solution, introduce a "global variable"...with this....



Modulations:

Use different output mapping....

Use different features....

Use different system models.....

- food sources/obstacles (ants example....)
- hartman benes change of leadership.....)
