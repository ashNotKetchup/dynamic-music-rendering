If a tree falls

Do musical constructs exist without observers/consumers?&#x20;

This piece imagines an Asimovian future world where musicians/musical organisms are part of the IoT...the viewer shapes the music (made literal as the max patch is built automated/in realtime \[via the max api] as people come in and interact with it...? \[Opportunity for the 4th wall metaphor in the SIML space]



\*My notes\*

aesthetically, this links to the idea of "if a tree falls", tree-themed audiovisuals, for example with the use of LSystems for musical rules as well as patch iteration (tree vis, + make patch reveal as a tree)

the piece is only driven forward as people vote on ideas like modulation/time sigs.&#x20;

gpt 3 prompts trained on asimovian stories (maybe someone else can build some AR? Build images from text prompts?

Decision by committee mirrors my own experience of working with A\&R as well as the constant negotiation of group performance (such as in jazz gigs). Only this time, I am externalising the musical negotiation process to the audience
